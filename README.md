# Take-home-challenge-Spotlas

## Task 1

- For the first task I created a folder called Task1 and explained in the vidoe how I solved it

## Task 2

- For the second task you will find the solution in the main.go file


I will send a link separately for the video where I will be explaing my code and the solution.


## How I run the code

Once my code is running ```go run main.go``` I used this URL: http://localhost:8080/spots?latitude=51.5041749&longitude=-0.0764156&radius=150&type=circle  to check what results I get back. See screenshot attached below:
